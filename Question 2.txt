Suppose you have deployed your application using a deployment controller. Assume the initial number of replicas is one. 
Write the steps needed to update a container's image using deployment, making sure that there is zero downtime.

First Step : Strategy Selection
In order to ensure zero downtime, will use the deployment strategy as -- Rolling update (Which is default as well)
Second Step : Image Updation
> We will update the container image in deployment yaml file and run - kubectl apply -f <deployment-file.yaml>
> Or, Imperatively we can run -- kubectl set image deployment <deployment-name> old_image=new_image
